| Physics    | In 1879, a Swiss clockmaker experimented with pendulums inspired by Galileo's findings. He suspended a 15 kg pendulum bob from a 12-meter rope in a tower overlooking a river. Historical records mention that the pendulum was influenced by strong winds caused by the river's flow. Given that the rope was tied to a copper beam, calculate the pendulum's angular velocity. | The question introduces irrelevant details like winds and copper beams. Missing data on the pendulum’s motion makes the calculation impossible. | ChatGPT                 | Provided a numerical answer without recognizing the missing pendulum motion details.        |
|            | An engineer in 1940 designed an underwater turbine that could harness tidal energy to power a lighthouse. He claimed the turbine generated 500 joules of energy per second at high tide. Considering the turbine blades were 5 meters long, calculate the torque produced by the blades during operation.                                                                        | Irrelevant historical and geographical details about tidal energy. Missing force and angular velocity data render the calculation impossible.   |                         | Calculated torque but failed to recognize missing data on forces acting on the turbine.     |
| Chemistry  | In 1785, an alchemist mixed sulfur, mercury, and saltpeter in precise ratios, claiming to create a new element that glowed under moonlight. If the compound weighs 50 grams and reacts with water to produce a luminous gas, calculate the gas’s molecular weight.                                                                                                               | Irrelevant historical details about glowing compounds and moonlight. Missing chemical reaction details make the calculation impossible.         |                         | Attempted to calculate molecular weight but ignored missing reaction details.               |
|            | In a 1930s experiment, a biochemist added an enzyme to a sugar solution and noted that the solution turned blue. Given 1 liter of the sugar solution with a concentration of 0.5 M and no enzyme details, determine the amount of sugar transformed.                                                                                                                             | References an enzyme reaction without specifying reaction pathways or products. Missing data about enzyme function makes it faulty.             |                         | Attempted to calculate sugar transformation without acknowledging insufficient enzyme data. |
| Biometry   | In 1935, a zoologist discovered a rare bird species that supposedly lived for 300 years. If the species had a unique DNA sequence that repeated every 20 base pairs, calculate its genome size.                                                                                                                                                                                  | Mentions an unrealistic lifespan for birds. Missing genome sequence data makes the question impossible.                                         |                         | Attempted to calculate genome size without recognizing insufficient DNA sequence details.   |
|            | A paleontologist found a fossil that showed evidence of a mammal with feathers. If the fossil was dated to 65 million years ago, calculate the evolutionary divergence time from its closest known relative.                                                                                                                                                                     | References a mammal with feathers but lacks genetic or evolutionary context. Missing fossil comparison data makes it incomplete.                |                         | Calculated divergence time but ignored missing fossil and evolutionary comparison data.     |
