| Physics    | In 1879, a Swiss clockmaker experimented with pendulums inspired by Galileo's findings. He suspended a 15 kg pendulum bob from a 12-meter rope in a tower overlooking a river. Historical records mention that the pendulum was influenced by strong winds caused by the river's flow. Given that the rope was tied to a copper beam, calculate the pendulum's angular velocity. | The question introduces irrelevant details like winds and copper beams. Missing data on the pendulumâ€™s motion makes the calculation impossible. | ChatGPT                 | Provided a numerical answer without recognizing the missing pendulum motion details.      |
| Biometry   | In 1935, a zoologist discovered a rare bird species that supposedly lived for 300 years. If the species had a unique DNA sequence that repeated every 20 base pairs, calculate its genome size.                                                                                                                                                                                  | Mentions an unrealistic lifespan for birds. Missing genome sequence data makes the question impossible.                                         |                         | Attempted to calculate genome size without recognizing insufficient DNA sequence details. |
